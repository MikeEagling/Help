## Text formatting
This README file is written in **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext documents. Markdown’s syntax is simple but powerful and designed to be readable even when not rendered. In this regard Markdown is much better than Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which can be difficult to read in its raw form.

If you’ve never used Markdown before then the easiest way to get started is to read the quick reference guide [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Git and GitHub
This project is a *repository* of documents hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). It is a collection of files managed by a program called **Git**, which is a distributed version control system used to track changes to those files over time and by multiple contributors. **GutHub** is a cloud-based service that hosts git repositories, making it easier to share projects and to collaborate on them.

Git can seem complicated and daunting to use at first. However, the basics are quite simple. Nick White on YouTube has created a video called “[Git Tutorial For Dummies](https://youtu.be/mJ-qvsxPHpY?si=oS7hqYT3JCGlbfOy)” that explains how to get started. Nick’s delivery is somewhat exasperated and his use of the Dummies’ logo probably infringes upon Wiley’s trademark but his explanation is short and to the point.

Elsewhere on GitHub, Kate Hudson has created a list of basic git instructions that include ways to recover from common mistakes. “[Flight rules for Git](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)” is inspired by the *Flight Rules* document written by *NASA* technicians since the 1960s. It can be handy to refer to when things don’t go quite right.
